I develop this social network to improve my React skills.
In my work I use React and the following libraries:

- Redux
- react-redux
- redux-thunk
- react-router
- axios
- redux-form

For styles I use Sass(SCSS) and BEM methodology.
TypeScript is used for controlling types.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
